# Starcounter on .NET Core intro sample

The sample in this project shows how our core API's run on the new .NET Core platform. This is a work in progress.

## How to run

1. Get the .NET Core SDK http://dot.net
2. Install the latest [Starcounter 2.3](http://downloads.starcounter.com/download/Starcounter/PnextNightlyBuilds/latest)
3. Clone this repo
4. run `dotnet restore` in the root folder
5. Navigate to `Sample` and run `dotnet run`

This will launch Starcounter 2.3 bluestar automatically (if not already running) and create database "starcore" if it doesn't exist.
